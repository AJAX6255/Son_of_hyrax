# Son_of_hyrax
Quick clone site to add bells and whistles "Open in Colab" to the demo hyrax astronomy ML notebooks. Some of this is an attempt to reduce the original repo's total token count in order to mount it as context reference in several LLM sites. Hopefully this will make the process of implementing Colab notebooks with hyrax less problematic.
